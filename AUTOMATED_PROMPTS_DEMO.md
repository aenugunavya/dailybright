# 🎯 Automated Daily Prompts - LIVE DEMO!

## ✨ What You Just Got

Your Daily Bright app now has a **fully automated daily prompt system** that generates fun, creative gratitude prompts every single day using OpenAI!

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Automated Generation** 
- **5 random times per day** (9:37 AM, 11:23 AM, 2:51 PM, 4:18 PM, 6:44 PM)
- Vercel cron jobs automatically call your API
- OpenAI generates a unique, creative prompt
- Stored in database for the day

### 2. **Smart & Creative Prompts**
Instead of boring "What are you grateful for?" questions, you get:
- 🎮 "What achievement did you unlock today?"
- 🎨 "If your day was a color, what would it be and why?"
- ⚡ "What superpower did you accidentally use today?"
- 🎵 "If your gratitude had a soundtrack, what genre would it play?"
- 🌤️ "Your day as a weather forecast: what was the emotional climate?"

### 3. **User Experience**
- Users visit `/dashboard/today` 
- See today's unique prompt
- Can respond with text + photos
- Responses are linked to specific daily prompts

## 🚀 To Test Right Now

### Option 1: Wait for Automatic Generation
Just wait! The cron jobs will automatically generate prompts at the scheduled times.

### Option 2: Manual Test (Development)
```bash
# Call the test endpoint (only works in development or when authenticated)

```

### Option 3: Direct Cron Test (Production)

## 🎨 What Makes These Prompts Special

### Creative Formats:
